                October 1959. Jailed by Belgian colonial regime for organizing
                protests demanding decolonisation and the independence of Congo.
              </li>
              <li>
                January 1960. Released from prison after much international
                pressure and participated in the international conference in
                which Belgium was forced to cede independence.
              </li>
              <li>
                May 1960. The Mouvement national congolais, co-founded by
                Lumumba, won Congo’s first national election. Patrice Lumumba
                became Congo’s founding prime minister.
              </li>
              <li>
                September 1960. Lumumba’s government was overthrow by Congolese
                military officers working in league with Belgium and the United
                States. He was placed under house arrest, guarded by UN
                soldiers. He later escaped from house arrest.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dec. 1, 1960. Arrested and jailed in very harsh conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                January 17, 1961. Murdered while in detention. The actual murder
                was carried out by Belgian-backed secessionists of Katanga
                province commanded by a Belgian officer at a Belgian-controlled
                military site. The record of the CIA’s collaboration with
                Belgium in deposing and then murdering Patrice Lumumba has been
                proven by the documentary record, including commissions of
                inquiry by the Belgian and the U.S. governments.
